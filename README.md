# CUDA Programming Examples

This repository contains GPU programming examples and optimization techniques using CUDA. My goal is to develop parallel computing capabilities with GPUs and experiment with different approaches to write more efficient code.

## Contents

- **Vector Addition**: Basic CUDA implementation of vector addition
- *More examples coming soon*

## Objectives

- Learn different parallel programming strategies
- Apply CUDA optimization techniques
- Optimize memory usage and data transfers
- Use GPU resources more efficiently

## Requirements

- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
- NVIDIA GPU (CUDA compatible)
- C/C++ compiler

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canbingol/CUDA.git
cd CUDA
nvcc vector_addition.cu -o vector_addition
./vector_addition
```
